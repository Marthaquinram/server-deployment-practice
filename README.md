# Starting up
- ensure you have your .env file set up
    - exapmle PORT=(enter in port number here)
- In terminal run npm i to install dependencies and then run npm test to run all test.
- In terminal run brew install sqlite3, sequalize
- Add DATABASE_URL with heroku postgres link to .env file.

#### Notes:
- Followed instructions and demo step by step and successfully got test to pass on local and github.
- Learned that yml is very picky about white spaces and indentation, that was causing my test to not work in github, got it fixed and it worked.
- I struggled writing the test for CRUD, I was only able to test for Create and reading the players/band but couldnt get Update and Delete to work.
